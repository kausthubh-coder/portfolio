Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. My experience with Node.js includes:

- Building RESTful APIs with Express.js
- Implementing authentication and authorization
- Working with databases like MongoDB and PostgreSQL
- Creating real-time applications with Socket.io
